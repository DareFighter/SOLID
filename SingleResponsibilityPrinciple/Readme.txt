SOLID 
S => Single Responsibility Principle
Each Software module or class should have only reason to change. In other words, we can say that  each module or class should have one one responsibility to do.

Advantages:
1. It will reduce the complexity of the application code. A code is based on its functionality. A calss holds the logic for a single functionality. So, it reduces the complexity of the application code.

2. it will increase readability, extensibility, an also maintenance. as each class or module has a single functionality. It is easy to read and maitain the application code.

3. It will increase the testability of the functions. When the functionality changes, then we do not need to test all the functionalities as each module is only having a single responsibility.

4. It will reduce the tight coupling between the software components. It reduced the dependency between the software components. One method's code does not depend on other mehtods. So, hcanges in one method will not reflect changes in another method.

5.
